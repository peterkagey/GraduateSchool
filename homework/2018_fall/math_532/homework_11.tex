\begin{problem}{1}
  Prove that every group of $2n$ children in which every child is friends with
  at least $n$ other children can be partitioned into pairs of friends in at
  least two different ways.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof} $ $ \\
  If two children are friends, they can be paired up in exactly one way.
  \\
  If four children each have two or more friends, then this is network is
  has a subgraph which is $C_4$, so it is
  sufficient to show that $C_4$ can be partitioned in two different ways.
  If the edges of $C_4$ are written $E = \set {v_1v_2, v_2v_3, v_3v_4, v_4v_1}$,
  then take the pairs $(v_1, v_2)$ and $(v_3, v_4)$ or else take the pairs
  $(v_4, v_1)$ and $(v_2, v_3)$.
  \\
  % With the base case established, take the child with the fewest friends, and
  % pair them off with their friend with the fewest friends.
  Take the child $v$ with the fewest friends, and pair them up with their friend
  $v'$ with the fewest friends. Sinc $v$ is assumed to have the fewest friends,
  $\deg(v) \leq \deg(v')$.
  % \\
  % \textbf{Case 1.} Assume $\deg(v) > n$, then all vertices in $V$ have at least
  % $n+1$ friends, so removing $v$ and $v'$ results in a new graph with $2n - 2$
  % vertices, where each vertex has degree of at least $n-1$.
  \\
  \textbf{Case 1.} Assume $\deg(v') > n$. There are no mutual friends of $v'$ and
  $v''$ with exactly $n$ friends (otherwise this friend would be named $v'$), so
  removing $v$ and $v'$ everyone with at least $n-1$ friends.
  \\
  \textbf{Case 2.} Assume $\deg(v) = \deg(v') = n$.
  % Assume $v$ and $v'$ have a friend named $v''$ such that
  % $\deg(v) = \deg(v') = \deg(v'')$.

% Second problem

\begin{problem}{2}
  Find the chromatic polynomial for the graph with \begin{align*}
    V &= \set{v_1, \hdots, v_n} \\
    E &= \set{v_1 v_2, v_2v_3, \hdots v_{n-1}v_{n}, v_1v_n}
      \cup \set{v_1v_3, v_1v_4, \hdots, v_1v_{n-1}},
  \end{align*} using the facts that the chromatic polynomial for the cyclic
  graph $C_n$ is \[
    P_{C_n}(k) = (k-1)^n + (-1)^n(k-1)
  \] and that the chromatic polynomial for any graph $G = G_1 \cup G_2$ where
  $G_1 \cap G_2 = \set{v}$ is \[
    P_G(k) = \frac{1}{k}p_{G_1}(k)p_{G_2}(k).
  \]
\end{problem}

\begin{solution} \text{} \\
  There are $k$ ways
  to pick the color for $v_1$, $(k-1)$ ways to pick the color for $v_2$, since
  $v_1$ is adjacent to $v_2$, and then $(k-2)$ ways to pick the color for $v_i$
  as $i$ goes from $3$ to $n$, since $v_i$ is adjacent to $v_1$ and $v_{i-1}$.
  Therefore if $G_n$ is the graph with $n$ vertices \[
    P_{G_n}(k) = k(k-1)(k-2)^{n-2}.
  \]
  \\~\\
  In order to use the hint, contraction/deletion gives \[
    P_{G_n}(k) = P_{G_n'}(k) - P_{G_n''}(k)
  \] where $G_n' = G_n - v_{n-1}v_n$ and $G_n'' = G_n/v_{n-1}v_n$.
  \\
  With induction hypothesis given above, using the information that $G_3 = C_3$,
  \begin{align*}
    P_{G_3}(k)
    &= P_{C_3}(k) \\
    &= (k-1)^3 - (k-1) \\
    &= (k-1)((k-1)^2 - 1) \\
    &= k(k-1)(k-2)
  \end{align*} so the base case is satisfied for $n=3$.
  \\
  The first graph in the contraction/deletion argument satisfies \[
    G_n' = G_{n-1} \cup \underbrace{(\set{v_1, v_n}, \set{v_1v_n})}_{C_2}
  \] where $G_{n-1} \cap C_2 = \set{v_{n-1}}$. Therefore, by the facts given
  along with the induction hypothesis, the chromatic
  polynomial of $G_n'$ is given by \begin{align*}
    P_{G_n'}(k)
    &= \frac 1k
      \cdot \underbrace{k(k-1)(k-2)^{n-2}}_{\displaystyle P_{G_{n-1}}(k)}
      \cdot \underbrace{k(k-1)}_{\displaystyle P_{C_2}(k)} \\
    &= k(k-1)^2(k-2)^{n-2}.
  \end{align*}
  Similarly, $G_n'' = G_{n-1}$, so by the induction hypothesis together with
  contraction deletion, \begin{align*}
    P_{G_n}(k) &= P_{G_n'}(k) - P_{G_n''}(k) \\
      &= k(k-1)^2(k-2)^{n-2} - k(k-1)(k-2)^{n-2} \\
      &= k(k-1)(k-2)^{n-2} ((k-1) - 1) \\
      &= k(k-1)(k-2)^{n-1},
  \end{align*} as desired.
\end{solution}

% Third problem

\begin{problem}{3}
  Using the deletion/retraction recurrence on a graph, prove that the number of
  acyclic orientations of $G$ is equal to $(-1)^{|V|}p_G(-1)$ where an acyclic
  orientation is an assignment of a direction to each edge such that there are
  no directed cycles.
\end{problem}

% Fourth problem
% -----------------------------------------------------
\begin{problem}{4}
  Let $G$ be a planar connected bipartite graph $V = V_1 \coprod V_2$ and
  $E \subset V_1 \times V_2$ such that there is no $4$-cycle and no vertex of
  degree $1$. Show that $3(|V|-2) \geq 2|E|$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution} \text{} \\
  Since $G$ is planar, the Euler characteristic states that \[
    v - 2 = e - f
  \]
  Since $G$ is bipartite, any cycle must have even length, so $G$ does not
  contain any $3$-cycles or $5$-cycles. Since $G$ is
  assumed to be simple (and therefore does not have multiple edges) $G$ does
  not contain any $2$-cycles. By assumption, $G$ does not contain any $4$-cycles.
  Thus any face of $G$ must be adjacent to $6$ or more edges, whenever $G$ has
  at least $6$ edges, and $G$ must have at least $6$ edges by the ``no vertex of
  degree $1$ criterion'' coupled with having no cycles smaller than $6$.
  \\~\\
  Since every edge is adjacent to at most two faces, and since $e \geq 6$, \[
    \frac f2 \leq \frac e6
  \] and so in particular \begin{alignat*}{2}
    v - 2 &= e - f &&\geq e - \frac 13e \\
    3(|V| - 2)& &&\geq 2|E|.
  \end{alignat*}
\end{solution}
