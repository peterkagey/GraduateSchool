\title{Counting subgraph structures of the $n \times k$ grid graph}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	A grid graph $G_{n,k}$ is a graph Cartesian product of two linear graphs
	$P_n \square P_k$. This talk presents a family of linear recurrences that
	arise from fixing $k$ and counting subgraphs on $G_{n,k}$ with various vertex
	and connectedness conditions.
