\question[6] {
  Suppose you want to draw a ``perfect'' five-point star on a poster for an
  event you're going to, and you know that for each of the five triangular arms,
  the angle at the top, $\alpha$, is half the angle at the base, $\beta$.
  What is the angle $\alpha$ of the tip of the star? \\
  (Recall that the three angles of a triangle add to $180^\circ$.)

\question[5] {
  Suppose you just got two offers for sales jobs. \begin{enumerate}
    \item[(A)] In job A, you will earn a base salary of $\$5000$ each month,
    plus $6\%$ of sales in commission.
    \item[(B)] In job B, you will earn a base salary of $\$4000$ each month,
    plus $10\%$ of sales in commission.
  \end{enumerate}
  Set up a linear inequality that describes the amount of sales that you'll have
  to do each month in order to make more money with the second job than with the
  first, where the variable $x$ denotes sales in dollars. Solve for $x$.

  Suppose you are a farmer with $100$ meters of fencing that you plan to use to
